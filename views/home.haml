        %h2 Our Process
        %p At Chromium 53, we work closely with our clients from start to finish. We believe that regular feedback throughout development makes the end result much closer to your vision of the project (Seems obvious â€“ if only more developers thought so!). The technical term for this feedback-driven development process is "Agile Development". Ruby on Rails enables us to provide you with working demonstrations at every step along the way. If you don't like the way something is working, you get to tell us early on.
